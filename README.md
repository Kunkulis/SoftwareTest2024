Hello,

Once again, thank you for the opportunity. This was my very first time working with C++, so I spent a considerable amount of time learning the language and setting up the environment.

AI was heavily involved in creating this solution. Unfortunately, due to time constraints and my limited experience, I wasnâ€™t able to explore different algorithms or dive deeply into C++ nuances. My primary focus was on making the solution efficient by avoiding multiple reads of the book data, creating a readable structure, adding tests for maintainability, and most importantly, completing the task on time. I also prioritized using clear variable names and writing clean methods/functions.

The biggest challenge for me was Part 2, especially integrating cURL and managing builds. However, once I switched to CMake, the process became much smoother.

Despite the challenges, this was a very interesting and enjoyable experience. Even though I struggled, it was fun to work with C++.
